Create in responsive design style a real-time data-driven widget for include it into any web page.
This is a like "Real-Time Forex Quotes Widget", let it will named as Widget.

IC Markets Widget (TEST TASK) requirements are (not in strict order, but important all together):

1) Periodically request actual data from: http://webrates.truefx.com/rates/connect.html?f=csv
2) Widget must automatically create data view elements (for example rows with cells, etc.) depends on received data (do not create html view part before data received)
3) Develop and use only one re-usable javascript class for all records of received data (create needed properties and methods)
4) Any of increased value should be on GREEN background color, decreased - on RED, in case if no changes - just BLACK text on initial background
5) All data should represents on the target web page in sorted order (by symbol name)
6) Update on the page ONLY really changed data (be ready to explain your implementation)
7) Target html page will have a special designed container with class name "widget-container"
8) Widget must be included into the target web page by using only one tag (<script>)
9) If possible, do not use third-party libraries and frameworks (only ECMAScript 5, inline-css, html5)
10) Test your result in all latest browsers (included IE9 in emulation mode, and mobile)
11) Developed widget must successfully fill given container in properly way with the next requirements:

- in case, if container has width >= 600px, represent data in format (like a table formatted list)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [forex symbol name] | [bid price] | [ask price] | [spread value] | [time of tick]
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- in case, if container has width >= 400px and < 600px, represent data like a table in format
  --------------------------------------------------
  [forex symbol name] | [bid price] | [spread value]
                      | [ask price] | [time of tick]
  --------------------------------------------------


- in case, if container has width < 400px, represent data like a table in format
  -------------------
  [time of tick     ]
  [forex symbol name]
  [spread value     ]
  [bid price        ]
  [ask price        ]
  -------------------


*) Like a Bonus is: how you will prevent refresh on the page currently INVISIBLE data (in case, when container has a vertical 
scroll and the some data can be outside from the view part of the screen), but refresh it imediately after data container will appear on the screen 
(by change scroll postion, etc)

**) As a test of the skills to use Google search: how would you do the continuation of the correct operation of the widget in the inactive tab of the browser, if such a task is set for you?

NOTE: if you have any questions - you a free to contact me, but as for me it is necessary to understand the level of your independence.

Please send you final, commented and tested results as soon as possible to my email: v.fedorov@icmarkets.com.au
The results of the code review and implementation questions will necessarily be during the Skype interview.

P.S. for * and **: Implementation is not required - enough verbal response at the interview))
